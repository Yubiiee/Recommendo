The World's Wife,Carol Ann Duffy,"This unique collection of poems from the Poet Laureate, filled with her characteristic wit, is a feminist classic and a modern take on age-old mythology. Who? Him. The Husband. Hero. Hunk. The Boy Next Door. The Paramour. The Je t'adore.

Gitanjali,Rabindranath Tagore,"Gitanjali (Song offering) is a collection of Bengali poems by the poet Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore received the Nobel Prize for Literature, largely for the book. And is part of the Collection from the UNESCO of Representative Works. The original Bengali collection of 103/157 poems was published on August 14, 1910. The English Gitanjali or Song Offerings is a collection of 103 English poems of Tagore's own English translations of his Bengali poems first published in November 1912 by the India Society of London. It contained translations of 53 poems from the original Bengali Gitanjali, as well as 50 other poems which were from his drama Achalayatan and eight other books of poetry - mainly Gitimalya (17 poems), Naivedya (15 poems) and Kheya (11 poems). The translations were often radical, leaving out or altering large chunks of the poem and in one instance fusing two separate poems (song 95, which unifies songs 89,90 of Naivedya). The translations were undertaken prior to a visit to England in 1912, where the poems were extremely well received. In 1913, Tagore became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, largely for the English Gitanjali. The English Gitanjali became popular in the West, and was widely translated. The word gitanjali is composed from ""geet"", song, and ""anjali"", offering, and thus means - ""An offering of songs""; but the word for offering, anjali, has a strong devotional connotation, so the title may also be interpreted as ""prayer offering of song"".

Rosmersholm,Henrik Ibsen,"Dramaet ""Rosmersholm"" fra 1886 anses af mange kritikere for at være Henrik Ibsens mesterværk. Det udspiller sig på en gammel herregård i det sydlige Norge, hvor den forhenværende præst Johannes Rosmer lever i et forhold med sin husholderske Rebecca West, mens konservative og liberale kræfter kæmper om magten i landet. Den norske dramatiker og digter Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906) er én af de vigtigste forfattere i Det Moderne Gennembrud og regnes som grundlæggeren af det moderne drama med skuespil, der sætter den menneskelige psykologi i centrum og kredser om den fortid, det er så umuligt at flygte fra. Ibsen er verdensberømt for skuespil som ""Et dukkehjem"", ""Peer Gynt"" og ""Hedda Gabler"", men producerede i alt over tyve dramaer, der stadig opføres på teatre over hele verden.",Poetry,2017-11-23,203,da,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iChADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=14&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iChADwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Inside Paradise Lost,David Quint,"Inside ""Paradise Lost"" opens up new readings and ways of reading Milton's epic poem by mapping out the intricacies of its narrative and symbolic designs and by revealing and exploring the deeply allusive texture of its verse. David Quint’s comprehensive study demonstrates how systematic patterns of allusion and keywords give structure and coherence both to individual books of Paradise Lost and to the overarching relationship among its books and episodes. Looking at poems within the poem, Quint provides new interpretations as he takes readers through the major subjects of Paradise Lost—its relationship to epic tradition and the Bible, its cosmology and politics, and its dramas of human choice. Quint shows how Milton radically revises the epic tradition and the Genesis story itself by arguing that it is better to create than destroy, by telling the reader to make love, not war, and by appearing to ratify Adam’s decision to fall and die with his wife. The Milton of this Paradise Lost is a Christian humanist who believes in the power and freedom of human moral agency. As this indispensable guide and reference takes us inside the poetry of Milton’s masterpiece, Paradise Lost reveals itself in new formal configurations and unsuspected levels of meaning and design.",Literary Criticism,2014-02-02,342,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2mmYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=16&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2mmYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Inferno,Dante,"An extraordinary new verse translation of Dante’s masterpiece, by poet, scholar, and lauded translator Anthony Esolen Of the great poets, Dante is one of the most elusive and therefore one of the most difficult to adequately render into English verse. In the Inferno, Dante not only judges sin but strives to understand it so that the reader can as well. With this major new translation, Anthony Esolen has succeeded brilliantly in marrying sense with sound, poetry with meaning, capturing both the poem’s line-by-line vigor and its allegorically and philosophically exacting structure, yielding an Inferno that will be as popular with general readers as with teachers and students. For, as Dante insists, without a trace of sentimentality or intellectual compromise, even Hell is a work of divine art. Esolen also provides a critical Introduction and endnotes, plus appendices containing Dante’s most important sources—from Virgil to Saint Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic theologians—that deftly illuminate the religious universe the poet inhabited.",Poetry,2005-10-25,0,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Yg6NEAAAQBAJ&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=18&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yg6NEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The spiritual and historical and human content is here in understandable, beautiful poetry: the correct rhyme-structure has been achieved, without intruding, in readable English. In the Introduction of 70 pages his wonderful life story is told in greater detail than anywhere else; his spirituality is explored, his influence on the life, poetry and art of the East and the West, the form and function of his poetry, and the use of his book as a worldly guide and spiritual oracle. His Divan, like the I Ching, is one of the world's Great Oracles. Included are notes to most poems, a glossary and a selected bibliography and two indexes. First published in a limited two-volume limited edition in 1986 the book quickly went out of print. Large Format Edition 7"" x 10"" 656 pages. Goethe: ""In his poetry Hafeez inscribed undeniable truth indelibly! He has no peer!"" Gertrude Bell: ""It is as if his mental Eye, endowed with wonderful acuteness of vision, had penetrated into those provinces of thought which we of a later age were destined to inhabit."" Meher Baba: ""There is no equal to Hafeez in poetry. He was a Perfect Master ... His Divan is the best book in the world because it engenders feelings which ultimately lead to illumination.""

The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems gathers all the poems Tomas Transtromer has published, from his distinctive first collection in 1954, 17 Poems, through his epic poem Baltics (""my most consistent attempt to write music""), and The Sad Gondola, published six years after he suffered a debilitating stroke in 1990 (""I am carried in my shadow / like a violin / in its black case.""), to his most recent slim book, The Great Enigma, published in Sweden in 2004.

The Iliad,"Homer, Samuel Butler","The Iliad, written more than 2.500 years ago, remains one of the classics of Western literature. It originally appeared in poem format, written in the rhythmic dactylic hexameter format, and tells the story of the ten year siege of the city of Troy during the Trojan War. By way of flashbacks and background setting, the work is the main source of many great legends of Greek mythology, including the cause of the war (the lover Paris and his stolen bride, the half-goddess Helen of Troy), the epic battle between the half-god warrior Achilles and the Trojan hero Hector following the death of Patroclus, the sack of Troy, and, of course, the death of Achilles through his one vulnerable spot-his heel. Other famous characters who appear in this epic work include Agamemnon, the King of Mycenae and leader of the Greeks; Odysseus, King of Ithaca; the warrior Ajax, Menelaus, King of Sparta, husband of Helen and brother of Agamemnon; Nestor, King of Pylos, and trusted advisor to Agamemnon; Priam, King of Troy; and Hecuba, Priam's wife. Numerous gods and goddesses also make their appearance, interfering in the events as their favorites engage each other in battle. The Iliad was regarded as a cultural treasure in the time of Classical Greece and its importance did not diminish with time. The Renaissance allowed its appearance in Western Europe and it has remained an important part of European culture and heritage for nearly three millennia.

Poetry and Politics in the Cockney School,Jeffrey N. Cox,"Jeffrey N. Cox refines our conception of 'second generation' Romanticism by placing it within the circle of writers around Leigh Hunt that came to be known as the 'Cockney School'. Offering a theory of the group as a key site for cultural production, Cox challenges the traditional image of the Romantic poet as an isolated figure by recreating the social nature of the work of Shelley, Keats, Hunt, Hazlitt, Byron, and others, as they engaged in literary contests, wrote poems celebrating one another, and worked collaboratively on journals and other projects.

Songs of Kabir,Saint Kabir,"The poet Kabir, a selection from whose songs is here for the first time offered to English readers, is one of the most interesting personalities in the history of Indian mysticism. Born in or near Benares, of Mohammedan parents, and probably about the year 1440, he became in early life a disciple of the celebrated Hindu ascetic Ramananda. Ramananda had brought to Northern India the religious revival which Ramanuja, the great twelfth-century reformer of Brahmanism, had initiated in the South. This revival was in part a reaction against the increasing formalism of the orthodox cult, in part an assertion of the demands of the heart as against the intense intellectualism of the Vedanta philosophy, the exaggerated monism which that philosophy proclaimed. It took in Ramanuja's preaching the form of an ardent personal devotion to the God Vishnu, as representing the personal aspect of the Divine Nature: that mystical ""religion of love"" which everywhere makes its appearance at a certain level of spiritual culture, and which creeds and philosophies are powerless to kill.",Poetry,2023-09-16,0,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=-hoo0AEACAAJ&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-hoo0AEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Concerning the Angels,Rafael Alberti,"First published in Spain in the summer of 1929, Concerning the Angels (Sobre los angeles) is the great Spanish poet Rafael Alberti's masterpiece, on a par with T.S.

The Flowers of Evil,"Charles Baudelaire, John Tidball","This book contains a completely new translation of the full text of the 1861 edition, completed in 2014. It has nothing to do with the reprints of an old public domain translation from 1909, with which it has been linked here. This new English verse translation, with footnotes, is followed by the original French text. The six poems which were banned in 1857 are also included. Charles Baudelaire's 'Les Fleurs du Mal' marked an important turning point in the history of world poetry, providing a crucial link between romanticism and modernism. The first one hundred and twenty-six poems in this book are as they appeared in the 1861 edition. These are followed by the six poems which were censored from the original edition of 1857. This brand new translation, completed in 2014, preserves the metre and rhyme scheme of each original poem. Some of the poems are very beautiful, while others are not for the faint-hearted. Taken as a whole, they convey the 'spleen' or 'ennui' which Baudelaire felt so keenly, a state of mind that echoes the 'mal du siecle' of early 19th century France.""",Poetry,2014-11-22,342,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BGjKrQEACAAJ&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BGjKrQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Not only deep, but they are also as capacious as the river Mahanadi that sustains the fishermen for centuries.

The travel poems are high on cognizance: ""We held out our hands for land; / they hurled us into blood. // We are ever on vigil; / we see the invisible.""

Victorian Sappho,Yopie Prins,"What is Sappho, except a name? Although the Greek archaic lyrics attributed to Sappho of Lesbos survive only in fragments, she has been invoked for many centuries as the original woman poet, singing at the origins of a Western lyric tradition. Victorian Sappho traces the emergence of this idealized feminine figure through reconstructions of the Sapphic fragments in late-nineteenth-century England. Yopie Prins argues that the Victorian period is a critical turning point in the history of Sappho's reception; what we now call ""Sappho"" is in many ways an artifact of Victorian poetics. Prins reads the Sapphic fragments in Greek alongside various English translations and imitations, considering a wide range of Victorian poets--male and female, famous and forgotten--who signed their poetry in the name of Sappho. By ""declining"" the name in each chapter, the book presents a theoretical argument about the Sapphic signature, as well as a historical account of its implications in Victorian England. Prins explores the relations between classical philology and Victorian poetics, the tropes of lesbian writing, the aesthetics of meter, and nineteenth-century personifications of the ""Poetess."" as current scholarship on Sappho and her afterlife. Offering a history and theory of lyric as a gendered literary form, the book is an exciting and original contribution to Victorian studies, classical studies, comparative literature, and women's studies.",History,1999-03-08,298,en,4,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=zvDmEgbXWfkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=58&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=zvDmEgbXWfkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

An inimitable volume, Journey to Armenia is a travel book in name only.

Haiku Moment,Bruce Ross,"Kagero Nikki, translated here as The Gossamer Years, belongs to the same period as the celebrated Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikuibu. This remarkably frank autobiographical diary and personal confession attempts to describe a difficult relationship as it reveals two tempestuous decades of the author's unhappy marriage and her growing indignation at rival wives and mistresses. Too impetuous to be satisfied as a subsidiary wife, this beautiful (and unnamed) noblewoman of the Heian dynasty protests the marriage system of her time in one of Japanese literature's earliest attempts to portray difficult elements of the predominant social hierarchy. A classic work of early Japanese prose, The Gossamer Years is an important example of the development of Heian literature, which, at its best, represents an extraordinary flowering of realistic expression, an attempt, unique for its age, to treat the human condition with frankness and honesty. A timeless and intimate glimpse into the culture of ancient Japan, this translation by Edward Seidensticker paints a revealing picture of married life in the Heian period.",Poetry,2011-12-27,372,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aZDTAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=65&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aZDTAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

The Oxford Book of War Poetry,Jon Stallworthy,"There can be no area of human experience that has generated a wider range of powerful feelings than war. The 250 poems included in this acclaimed anthology span centuries of human conflict - from David's lament for Saul and Jonathan, and Homer's Iliad, to the finest poems of the Second World War, Vietnam, Northern Ireland, and El Salvador, as well as the chilling visions of the 'Next War'. Reflecting the feelings of authors as diverse as Virgil, Daniel Defoe, Emily Dickinson, and Adrian Mitchell, they reveal a great shift in social awareness from man's early celebratory war-songs to the more recent anti-war attitudes of poets responding to 'man's inhumanity to man', and to women and children.

Yvain,Chretien de Troyes,"The twelfth-century French poet Chrétien de Troyes is a major figure in European literature. His courtly romances fathered the Arthurian tradition and influenced countless other poets in England as well as on the continent. Yet because of the difficulty of capturing his swift-moving style in translation, English-speaking audiences are largely unfamiliar with the pleasures of reading his poems. Now, for the first time, an experienced translator of medieval verse who is himself a poet provides a translation of Chrétien’s major poem, Yvain, in verse that fully and satisfyingly captures the movement, the sense, and the spirit of the Old French original. Yvain is a courtly romance with a moral tenor; it is ironic and sometimes bawdy; the poetry is crisp and vivid. In addition, the psychological and the socio-historical perceptions of the poem are of profound literary and historical importance, for it evokes the emotions and the values of a flourishing, vibrant medieval past.",Poetry,1987-09-10,242,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=CYLyAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=74&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=CYLyAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Beowulf,Anonymous,"A unique parallel edition of Beowulf with the original Anglo-Saxon and Gummere's celebrated poetic translation on facing pages. ""The whole thing is sombre, tragic, sinister, curiously real. ... . It is laden with history, leading back into the dark heathen ages beyond the memory of song, but not beyond the reach of imagination"" - J. R. R. Tolkien. The epic Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf had ""a deep and detailed impact on what Tolkien wrote - from his earliest poem of Middle-earth (1914), right through The Hobbit ... and The Lord of the Rings."" - John Garth author of Tolkien and the Great War. ""The story of Beowulf, Grendel, Grendel's mother and the Dragon [is] surely the basic story of all literature ... It is an epic that summons up a world whose trappings have long since disappeared, the trappings of the warrior ethos, and morality of almost prehistoric Germanic times; but the essential 'message' has not changed. It is about courage and resolve, about duty and responsibility, about honour and achievement; but it is also about the transitoriness of things, and the inevitability of death, however glorious the life. It is both a celebration of humanity and an elegy. The poem Beowulf is one of the glories of European literature."" - Magnus Magnusson. Beowulf, the greatest work of Anglo-Saxon literature, and ""one of the glories of European literature,"" is set in the mists of Scandinavia, interweaving history and myth. It has been translated into English over seventy times, has been widely studied, and has influenced the popular imagination through Tolkien's Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. The young hero, Beowulf, receiving reports that a monster has been terrorising the neighbouring Danes nightly in their sumptuous mead hall Heorot, sails to their aid with a small band of warriors. The Danish King Hrothgar, amazed at his courage, honours him with a celebratory feast, after the shadowy monster Grendel strikes. Beowulf, a man of suprahuman strength, though unarmed, fatally wounds Grendel, and later defeats his terrifying mother. Beowulf returns to Geatland, becomes King, and ruling with wisdom equalling his courage and strength, establishes peace for fifty years. However, an enterprising slave steals a jewelled cup from a sleeping dragon's hoard, whereupon the enraged dragon emerges spewing flames, killing villagers, and destroying homes. Beowulf, defender of his people, seeks the dragon in its lair; however, once the fire-breathing dragon emerges, he is abandoned by all but the young Wiglaf. The two ultimately slay the dragon, but only at the cost of a mortal injury to Beowulf. Beowulf, who has triumphed gloriously in life and died tragically, is given a funeral equal to any of the heroes of The Iliad or The Aeneid. This dual-language edition will be enjoyable for general readers, and invaluable for students who would like to read Beowulf in either Anglo-Saxon or modern English, while dipping into the other language to deepen pleasure or comprehension. It provides an enjoyable experience of the epic poem Beowulf.",Uncategorized,2021-10-28,186,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=GM-5zgEACAAJ&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=78&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GM-5zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Hands of Day,Pablo Neruda,"Pablo Neruda is one of the world's great poets, and Copper Canyon Press has long been dedicated to publishing translations of his work in bilingual editions. The Hands of Day--at long last translated into English in its entirety--pronounces Neruda's desire to take part in the great human making of the day. Moved by the guilt of never having worked with his hands, Neruda opens with the despairing confession, ""Why did I not make a broom? / Why was I given hands at all?"" The themes of hands and work grow in significance as Neruda celebrates the carpenters, longshoremen, blacksmiths, and bakers--those laborers he admires most--and shares his exuberant adoration for the earth and the people upon it. Yes, I am guilty of what I did not do, of what I did not sow, did not cut, did not measure, of never having rallied myself to populate lands, of having sustained myself in the deserts and of my voice speaking with the sand. Pablo Neruda (1904-1973) was a Chilean poet and diplomat who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1971. Recognized during his life as ""a people's poet,"" he is considered one of the greatest artists of the twentieth century. William O'Daly is the best-selling translator of six of Pablo Neruda's books, including The Book of Questions and The Sea and the Bells.

The Legend Of Sigurd And Gudrún,"J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien","Many years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien composed his own version of the great legend of Northern antiquity, recounted here in The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún. In the Lay of the Völsungs is told the ancestry of the great hero Sigurd, the slayer of Fáfnir, most celebrated of dragons; of his awakening of the Valkyrie Brynhild, who slept surrounded by a wall of fire, and of their betrothal; and of his coming to the court of the great princes who were named the Niflungs (or Nibelungs), with whom he entered into blood-brotherhood. In scenes of dramatic intensity, of confusion of identity, thwarted passion, jealousy, and bitter strife, the tragedy of Sigurd and Brynhild, of Gunnar the Niflung and Gudrún his sister, mounts to its end in the murder of Sigurd, the suicide of Brynhild, and the despair of Gudrún. The Lay of Gudrún recounts her fate after the death of Sigurd, her marriage against her will to the mighty Atli, ruler of the Huns (the Attila of history), his murder of her brothers, and her hideous revenge.",Fiction,2012-02-15,233,en,3,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=A5sml5DtK4kC&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=97&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A5sml5DtK4kC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Life Could Be Verse,Kirk Douglas,"Discover the life and lines of Spartacus. . . He is Spartacus. And a whole lot more. That rugged chin. Those broad shoulders. A swag epitomized in epic films such as Spartacus and The Bad and the Beautiful. Crowned one of greatest actors of all time, Kirk Douglas, whose son Michael continues to build on his Hollywood legacy, is more than legendary. He's a husband. A father. A philanthropist. A Renaissance man. At 97 years old, Kirk Douglas has embraced many roles. But poet? Playing on his Yiddish roots, Life Could Be Verse--not worse--gives readers the best seat in the house to the intimate world of an acclaimed actor who has turned the silver screen gold. But his poems transcend pentameters--they are nostalgic celebrations of old Hollywood, of timeless lessons in life and love, reflecting an era when people had few coins in their pockets but an abundance of hope in the promise of the American dream. Through poems, prose, and photographs, Douglas candidly shares it all as he chaperones us through the stages of his life, including the untimely death of his youngest son and the stroke that left him unable to speak. Still, Douglas doesn't dwell in the sadness. Instead, he tantalizes us with his words, his perspective on life, and some never-before-seen photographs and stories of Marlene Dietrich, Lauren Bacall, Brigitte Bardot and his most cherished leading lady of all, his wife of sixty years, Anne Buydens. Life Could Be Verse is uncomplicated yet revealing, poignant yet playful. It's the life and the lines of Spartacus-an uplifting reminder that many times the story of our lives is the most entertaining script of all. (The following is an original poem Kirk wrote about his famous son Michael Douglas): Fathers and Sons ""Am I a good father?'"" I asked my son He took a pause, too long for me I waited and waited for him to answer And finally he said, ""Ultimately."" But the pause was all I heard The silence was so loud I was waiting for some kind word Something that would make me proud. How could I have been so dumb? And I never heard The answer in the pause, When he spoke not a word. I became a ""good father,"" It took me too long to see, When I needed him More than he needed me.",Biography & Autobiography,2014-12-02,120,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=k9IkBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=99&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=k9IkBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

Ovid Revisited,Jo-Marie Claassen,"In time for the bimillennium of Ovid's relegation to Tomis on the Black Sea by the emperor Augustus in 8 AD, Jo-Marie Claassen here revises and integrates into a more popular format two decades of scholarship on Ovid's exile. Some twenty articles and reviews from scholarly journals have been shortened, rearranged and merged into seven chapters, which, together with some new material, offer a wide-ranging overview of the exiled poet and his works. ""Ovid Revisited"" treats the poems from exile as the literary culmination of Ovid's oeuvre, ascribing the poet's resilience in the face of extreme hardship to the relief that his poetry afforded him. An introduction considers the phenomenon of Ovid's continued popularity, explains the importance of chronology in reading the exilic poems and gives a brief summary of the contents of the 'Tristia' and 'Epistulae ex Ponto'. The rest of the book ranges from consideration of Ovid's relationship with the emperor and with his own poetry, to his ubiquitous humour, to his skill in metrics, vocabulary and verbal play, and to his use of mythological figures from earlier parts of his oeuvre. The degree to which Ovid universalised the sufferings of the dispossessed is assessed in a chapter comparing his exilic works with modern exilic literature. An excursus considers various directions in Ovidian studies today.",Literary Criticism,2013-11-20,430,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=BfTUAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=105&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BfTUAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api
Wittgenstein's Ladder,Marjorie Perloff,"“[Perloff] has brilliantly adapted Wittgenstein’s conception of meaning and use to an analysis of contemporary language poetry.” —Linda Voris, Boston Review Marjorie Perloff, among our foremost critics of twentieth-century poetry, argues that Ludwig Wittgenstein provided writers with a radical new aesthetic, a key to recognizing the inescapable strangeness of ordinary language. Taking seriously Wittgenstein’s remark that “philosophy ought really to be written only as a form of poetry,” Perloff begins by discussing Wittgenstein the “poet.” What we learn is that the poetics of everyday life is anything but banal. “This book has the lucidity and the intelligence we have come to expect from Marjorie Perloff.” —Linda Munk, American Literature “Wittgenstein’s Ladder offers significant insights into the current state of poetry, literature, and literary study. Perloff emphasizes the vitality of reading and thinking about poetry, and the absolute necessity of pushing against the boundaries that define and limit our worlds.” —David Clippinger, Chicago Review “Majorie Perloff has done more to illuminate our understanding of twentieth century poetic language than perhaps any other critic . . .

Orlando Innamorato,"Matteo Maria Boiardo, William Stewart Rose, Francesco Berni","Orlando Innamorato of Matteo Maria Boiardo. Translated into prose from the Italian of Francesco Berni and interspersed with extracts in the same stanza as the original by William Stewart Rose. Orlando Innamorato (Orlando in Love) is an epic poem written by the Italian Renaissance author Matteo Maria Boiardo. The poem is a romance concerning the heroic knight Orlando (Roland). The beautiful Angelica, daughter of the king of Cataio (Cathay), comes to Charlemagne's court for a tournament in which both Christians and pagans can participate. She offers herself as a prize to whoever will defeat her brother, Argalia, who in the consequent competition fighting imprisons many Christians. But then Ferraguto (aka Ferrau) kills Argalia and Angelica flees, chased by many paladins, especially Orlando and Rinaldo. Stopping in the Ardenne forest, she drinks at the Stream of Love (making her fall in love with Rinaldo), while Rinaldo drinks at the fount of hate (making him conceive a passionate hatred of Angelica): first reversal. She asks the magician Malagigi to kidnap Rinaldo, and the magician brings him to an enchanted island, while she returns to Cataio where she is besieged by king Agricane, another of her admirers, in the fortress of Albracca. Orlando comes to kill Agricane and to free her, and he succeeds. Afterwards, Rinaldo tries to convince him to return to France to fight alongside Charlemagne: consequently, Orlando and Rinaldo duel furiously. In the meantime the Saracen king Agramante has invaded France with a massive army (along with Rodomonte, Ferrau, Gradasso, and many others), to avenge his father Troiano, previously killed by Orlando. Rinaldo rushes back to France, chased by Angelica in love with him, in turn chased by Orlando. Back in the Ardenne forest, this time Rinaldo and Angelica drink at the opposite founts: second reversal. Orlando and Rinaldo duel again for Angelica, and Charlemagne decides to entrust her to the old and wise duke Namo, offering her to the one who will fight most valorously against the infidels. In the meantime, the Saracen paladin Ruggiero and Rinaldo's sister, Bradamante, fall in love. The poem stops there abruptly, with Boiardo's narrator explaining that he can write no more because Italy has been invaded by French troops headed by king Charles VIII. (Ariosto's Orlando Furioso will resume from that point.)",Poetry,2014-07-11,150,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=iEL4oAEACAAJ&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=113&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iEL4oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Leaves of Grass,Walt Witman,"Leaves of Grass is a poetry collection by the American poet Walt Whitman . Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent most of his professional life writing and re-writing Leaves of Grass, revising it multiple times until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades.The poems of Leaves of Grass are loosely connected, with each representing Whitman's celebration of his philosophy of life and humanity. This book is notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass exalted the body and the material world.This is a collections of his books.",Uncategorized,2016-12-16,648,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=twRLMQAACAAJ&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=133&source=gbs_api,No thumbnail available

And after seven moons, one day a soothsayer looked at me, and he said to my mother, ""Your son will be a statesman and a great leader of men."" But I cried out, --""That is a false prophet; for I shall be a musician, and naught but a musician shall I be."" But even at that age my language was not understood--and great was my astonishment. And after three and thirty years, during which my mother, and the nurse, and the priest have all died, (the shadow of God be upon their spirits) the soothsayer still lives. And yesterday I met him near the gates of the temple; and while we were talking together he said, ""I have always known you would become a great musician.

The Magnetic Fields,"Andre Breton, Philippe Soupault","An indispensible classic of French poetry, this is a new translation of Breton and Soupault's experiment with automatic writing, and also the first known work of literary surrealism. In the spring of 1919, two young men, André Breton and Philippe Soupault, both in a state of shock after World War I, embarked on an experiment. Sick of the literary cultivation of “voice,” sick of the “well-written,” they wanted to unleash the power of the word and to create “a new morality” to replace “the prevailing morality, the source of all our trials and tribulations.” They had a plan. They would write for a week on every day of the week and they would write fast, as fast as possible, in complete secrecy. When the week was over, the writing would be done. No touching up. This was how The Magnetic Fields, the first sustained exercise in automatic writing, came to be.

The Apple That Astonished Paris,Billy Collins,"Bruce Weber in the New York Times called Billy Collins “the most popular poet in America.” He is the author of many books of poetry, including, most recently, The Rain in Portugal: Poems. In 1988 the University of Arkansas Press published Billy Collins’s The Apple That Astonished Paris, his “first real book of poems,” as he describes it in a new, delightful preface written expressly for this new printing to help celebrate both the Press’s twenty-fifth anniversary and this book, one of the Press’s all-time best sellers. In his usual witty and dry style, Collins writes, “I gathered together what I considered my best poems and threw them in the mail.” After “what seemed like a very long time” Press director Miller Williams, a poet as well, returned the poems to him in the “familiar self-addressed, stamped envelope.” He told Collins that there was good work here but that there was work to be done before he’d have a real collection he and the Press could be proud of: “Williams’s words were more encouragement than I had ever gotten before and more than enough to inspire me to begin taking my writing more seriously than I had before.” This collection includes some of Collins’s most anthologized poems, including “Introduction to Poetry,” “Another Reason Why I Don’t Keep a Gun in the House,” and “Advice to Writers.” Its success over the years is testament to Collins’s talent as one of our best poets, and as he writes in the preface, “this new edition . . . is a credit to the sustained vibrancy of the University of Arkansas Press and, I suspect, to the abiding spirit of its former director, my first editorial father.”",Poetry,2014-02-01,81,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=u57fAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=155&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=u57fAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api

War Primer,Bertolt Brecht,"A terrifying series of short poems by one of the world’s leading playwrights, set to images of World War II In this singular book written during World War Two, Bertolt Brecht presents a devastating visual and lyrical attack on war under modern capitalism. He takes photographs from newspapers and popular magazines, and adds short lapidary verses to each in a unique attempt to understand the truth of war using mass media. Pictures of catastrophic bombings, propaganda portraits of leading Nazis, scenes of unbearable tragedy on the battlefield — all these images contribute to an anthology of horror, from which Brecht’s perceptions are distilled in poems that are razor-sharp, angry and direct.

Ghalib - Persian Poems,Ghalib,"GHALIB: PERSIAN POEMS Translation & Introduction Paul Smith Mirza Asadullah Beg (1797-1869}, known as Ghalib (conqueror), a pen-name or takhallus he adopted in the tradition of classical Persian and Urdu poets, was born in the city of Agra of parents with Turkish aristocratic ancestry. When he was only five his father Abdullah Beg Khan died in a battle while working under Rao Raja Bakhtwar Singh of Alwar and his uncle Nasrullah Beg Khan took charge of him. But he lost his uncle also at the age of eight. He then moved to Delhi. He lived on state patronage, credit or the generosity of friends. His fame came to him posthumously. His major poetry was ghazals, qit'as, ruba'is and othe forms in Persian, he is more famous for those written in Urdu. Dr. Arifshah Gilani, author of 'Ghalib: His Life and Persian Poetry' (see bibliography) states: ""Ghalib is, to all intents and purposes, the last of the great classical poets of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent, because although the late Dr. Sir Muhammad Iqbal has made a distinct and valuable contribution in Persian poetry, still in so far as the language is concerned, he cannot be said to have even approached Ghalib, much less surpassed him."" He also states, ""Strictly speaking, the real Ghalib lies not only in the twelve hundred Urdu verses but also in the twelve thousand and odd couplets of his Persian poetry... Like an eagle he flew over all the rest. In fact, he was a giant amongst the pygmies. His many sided genius should earn him and abiding niche in the domain of Persian poetry."" Here is the largest selection of his ghazals and other poems from the Persian in the correct form and meaning with Introduction on his Life, Times, Poetry, The Forms of he composed in, Selected Bibliography.

""It is not a joke... the English version of ALL the ghazals of Hafiz is a great feat and of paramount importance. I am astonished.

Irish Melodies (Classic Reprint),Thomas Moore,"Excerpt from Irish Melodies The recollections connected, in my mind, with that early period of my life, when I first thought of interpreting in verse the touching language of my country's music, tempt me again to advert to those long past days; and even at the risk of being thought to indulge overmuch in what Colley Gibber calls ""the great pleasure of writing about one's self all day,"" to notice briefly some of those impressions and influences under which the attempt to adapt words to our ancient Melodies was for some time meditated by me, and, at last, undertaken. There can be no doubt that to the zeal and industry of Mr. Bunting his country is indebted for the preservation of her old national airs. During the prevalence of the Penal Code, the music of Ireland was made to share in the fate of its people.

The Raven,Edgar Allan Poe,"""The Raven"" follows an unnamed narrator on a dreary night in December who sits reading ""forgotten lore"" by a dying fire as a way to forget the death of his beloved Lenore. A ""tapping at chamber door"" reveals nothing, but excites his soul to ""burning"". The tapping is repeated, slightly louder, and he realizes it is coming from his window. When he goes to investigate, a raven flutters into his chamber. Paying no attention to the man, the raven perches on a bust of Pallas above the door.Amused by the raven's comically serious disposition, the man asks that the bird tell him its name. The raven's only answer is ""Nevermore"".The narrator is surprised that the raven can talk, though at this point it has said nothing further. The narrator remarks to himself that his ""friend"" the raven will soon fly out of his life, just as ""other friends have flown before""along with his previous hopes. As if answering, the raven responds again with ""Nevermore"".The narrator reasons that the bird learned the word ""Nevermore"" from some ""unhappy master"" and that it is the only word it knows.",Uncategorized,2021-02-10,41,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=7PbgzgEACAAJ&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=178&source=gbs_api,No thumbnail available

Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie,Henry W. Longfellow,"Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie (1847) is an epic poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. A master of poetic tradition and form, Longfellow wrote Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie in dactylic hexameter, the meter of such classical epics as Homer's Iliad and Odyssey as well as Virgil's Aeneid. Inspired by the experience of the Acadians, a Francophone people living in northern Maine and the Canadian Maritime provinces who were forcefully expelled by British forces during the French and Indian War, Longfellow composed his American epic, a story of faith, romance, and perseverance steeped in tradition and beloved by generations to come. In the French colony of Acadie, a young woman named Evangeline Bellefontaine marries Gabriel Lajeunesse. They begin their lives together in happiness, surrounded by the beauty of the forests and waters of the Maritimes. When war breaks out between the French and the British, the Acadians are forced out of their homes by the advancing British. Separated from Gabriel, Evangeline makes her way across America in search of safety and her missing husband. After several near misses and years of living on the road, Evangeline settles in Philadelphia, where she joins a convent and cares for the sick as a deadly epidemic sweeps across the land. Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie is an epic of a forgotten history, a tale of hardship and the love that would overcome it. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie is a classic of American literature reimagined for modern readers.",Poetry,2021-03-09,60,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Gd9VzgEACAAJ&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=193&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Gd9VzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

The Golden Treasury - Selected from the Best Songs and Lyrical Poems in the English Language,Francis T. Palgrave,"PREFACE. THE Author of this very practical treatise on Scotch Loch - Fishing desires clearly that it may be of use to all who had it. He does not pretend to have written anything new, but to have attempted to put what he has to say in as readable a form as possible. Everything in the way of the history and habits of fish has been studiously avoided, and technicalities have been used as sparingly as possible. The writing of this book has afforded him pleasure in his leisure moments, and that pleasure would be much increased if he knew that the perusal of it would create any bond of sympathy between himself and the angling community in general. This section is interleaved with blank shects for the readers notes. The Author need hardly say that any suggestions addressed to the case of the publishers, will meet with consideration in a future edition. We do not pretend to write or enlarge upon a new subject. Much has been said and written-and well said and written too on the art of fishing but loch-fishing has been rather looked upon as a second-rate performance, and to dispel this idea is one of the objects for which this present treatise has been written. Far be it from us to say anything against fishing, lawfully practised in any form but many pent up in our large towns will bear us out when me say that, on the whole, a days loch-fishing is the most convenient. One great matter is, that the loch-fisher is depend- ent on nothing but enough wind to curl the water, -and on a large loch it is very seldom that a dead calm prevails all day, -and can make his arrangements for a day, weeks beforehand whereas the stream- fisher is dependent for a good take on the state of the water and however pleasant and easy it may be for one living near the banks of a good trout stream or river, it is quite another matter to arrange for a days river-fishing, if one is looking forward to a holiday at a date some weeks ahead. Providence may favour the expectant angler with a good day, and the water in order but experience has taught most of us that the good days are in the minority, and that, as is the case with our rapid running streams, -such as many of our northern streams are, -the water is either too large or too small, unless, as previously remarked, you live near at hand, and can catch it at its best. A common belief in regard to loch-fishing is, that the tyro and the experienced angler have nearly the same chance in fishing, -the one from the stern and the other from the bow of the same boat. Of all the absurd beliefs as to loch-fishing, this is one of the most absurd. Try it. Give the tyro either end of the boat he likes give him a cast of ally flies he may fancy, or even a cast similar to those which a crack may be using and if he catches one for every three the other has, he may consider himself very lucky. Of course there are lochs where the fish are not abundant, and a beginner may come across as many as an older fisher but we speak of lochs where there are fish to be caught, and where each has a fair chance. Again, it is said that the boatman has as much to do with catching trout in a loch as the angler. Well, we dont deny that. In an untried loch it is necessary to have the guidance of a good boatman but the same argument holds good as to stream-fishing...",Poetry,2007-11,544,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=D69FSSCsnfAC&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=196&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=D69FSSCsnfAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
Chamber Music,James Joyce,"2012 Reprint of 1907 Edition. Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. 'Chamber Music' is a collection of poems by James Joyce first published 1907. The collection originally comprised thirty-four love poems, but two further poems were added before publication. Although the poems did not sell well (fewer than half of the original print run of 500 had been sold in the first year), they received some critical acclaim. Ezra Pound admired the ""delicate temperament"" of these early poems, while Yeats described ""I hear an army charging upon the land"" as ""a technical and emotional masterpiece."" In 1909, Joyce wrote to his wife, ""When I wrote [Chamber Music], I was a lonely boy, walking about by myself at night and thinking that one day a girl would love me.""",Fiction,2012,42,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=nv9ztQAACAAJ&dq=subject:poetry&hl=&cd=197&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nv9ztQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
