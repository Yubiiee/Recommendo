Gentle but deadly Susanna with her startling, differently coloured eyes is a witch, a High Priestess of the druidic groves, struggling to embrace the best of Christianity. But the monstrous Yellow Curate will stop at no evil to rid the world of her and her ancient beliefs. Hunter Taylor seamlessly joins 14th Century fact, myth and magic to take her reader on a breathtaking odyssey through a land in the birth pangs of change, where Susanna is never more than a footstep ahead of the sadistic cleric obsessed with her destruction. And behind every tree, every crumbling stone wall, every wooded hill, the Insatiate Archer lies in wait, caring little whose heart his next arrow will pierce. Hunter Taylor's immaculate research and magical writing style create a dazzling reality we may only before have experienced in our dreams and our nightmares. Insatiate Archer is a novel of harsh truths in the most cruel of times, sometimes hard to bear as you tear through its pages. It is not a book for the faint-hearted."" --Publisher.",Fiction,2007-03,270,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=bN0JtAEACAAJ&dq=subject:action&hl=&cd=43&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bN0JtAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

In lieu of this, his grief-stricken mother, Serena, enlisted the aid of a person she has heard of in her travels, in the hope that, perhaps, his soul could be saved.
