The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,Mark Twain,"""It's a lazy Mississippi River town, a place where a boy can learn magical cures for warts, turn a fence-painting job into a leisurely con game, get lost in a cave, escape to an island, or attend his own funeral. It's a time when hooky is punished with a simple swatting and pockets bulge with firecrackers and dead rats; a time when graves are dug up, and boys are fearful of murderous Injuns, when treasures are found, and hearts are won; a time when a prank can lead to a hero's world. It's a fantasy world, this world of Tom Sawyer--a tribute to boyhood, a chance to dream of idle days or skip off on high adventure. It's a warm and scary and funny and unforgettable experience""--Page 4 of cover.",Adventure,1965,230,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=0S_uAAAAMAAJ&dq=subject:adventure&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0S_uAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Percy Jackson and the Greek Gods,Rick Riordan,"A publisher in New York asked me to write down what I know about the Greek gods, and I was like, Can we do this anonymously? Because I don't need the Olympians mad at me again. But if it helps you to know your Greek gods, and survive an encounter with them if they ever show up in your face, then I guess writing all this down will be my good deed for the week. So begins Percy Jackson's Greek Gods, in which the son of Poseidon adds his own magic--and sarcastic asides--to the classics. He explains how the world was created, then gives readers his personal take on a who's who of ancients, from Apollo to Zeus. Percy does not hold back. ""If you like horror shows, blood baths, lying, stealing, backstabbing, and cannibalism, then read on, because it definitely was a Golden Age for all that."" This novel-sized paperback, complete with an insert of full-color illustrations by Caldecott Honoree John Rocco, is portable and friendly, and the ideal way to introduce young readers to the classic stories. Praise for Percy Jackson's Greek Gods ""Percy's gift, which is no great secret, is to breathe new life into the gods. Closest attention is paid to the Olympians, but Riordan has a sure touch when it comes to fitting much into a small space-as does Rocco's artwork, which smokes and writhes on the page as if hit by lightning. . .The inevitable go-to for Percy's legions of fans who want the stories behind his stories."" -Kirkus Reviews ""The age-old stories are endlessly strong, resonant, and surprising, while the telling here is fresh, irreverent, and amusing. Percy's voice. . . John Rocco illustrates the myths with drama, verve, and clarity. A must-have addition to the Percy Jackson canon."" -Booklist Online ""Combining the sarcasm and wit of Percy Jackson with the original Greek myths is a great way to hook tweens and teens on the stories without boring them. The beautiful illustrations by John Rocco enhance each story. . ."" -VOYA",Children's stories,2015-05-07,0,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=eBTaoQEACAAJ&dq=subject:adventure&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eBTaoQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api

Coots in the North and Other Stories,Arthur Ransome,"While working on his book The Life of Arthur Ransome, Hugh Brogan chanced upon the unfinished scrip of a thirteenth 'Swallows and Amazons' story in Ransome's desk in the Abbot Hall Museum in Cumbria, where it had lain unknown except to a few. It had no title ('Coots in the North' is Brogan's invention) but there were a few preliminary drawings which Ransome might have included had this gem been brought to life in book form. Why he abandoned it is not know, for he left a clear outline of how he intended to go on once the three young Coots - Joe, Bill and Pete - had completed their hair-raising journey as stowaways from Norfolk to the lakes in the North. There, on a salvage mission, they encounter for the first time the intrepid Nancy Blackett. 'Coots in the North' is introduced by Brogan's lively account of how Arthur Ransome found fame and fortune through the Swallows and Amazons, and is accompanied in this collection by other delights which turned up among Ransome's papres in the Brotherton Library at Leeds University. An unfinished Victorian 'Bevis'-style novel yielded two superb stories, complete in themselves - 'The Cloudburst' and a fishing tale called 'The River Comes First'. The Baltic sailing mysteries originally published in Pall Mall Magazine in 1929, 'Two Shorts and a Long' and 'The Unofficial Side'; the Breton ghost story 'Ankou', which first appeared in English review in1914; and an eerie cautionary tale of old Russia called 'The Shepherd's Pipe' complete this testament to Ransome's storytelling genius, which should not be missed by enthusiasts young or old.",Fiction,1988,152,en,No rating,http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Yd4kW8nkMlwC&dq=subject:adventure&hl=&cd=101&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Yd4kW8nkMlwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api
